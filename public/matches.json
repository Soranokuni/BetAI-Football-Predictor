    "reasoning": "RSB Berkane will be looking to start their CAF Champions League campaign with a win at home against Power Dynamos. While Power Dynamos can be dangerous, Berkane's home advantage and continental experience should see them secure a positive result. A double chance bet on RSB Berkane is a safe option. Backing RSB Berkane to win outright offers better value, given their aspirations in the competition and Power Dynamos' inconsistent away form."
